I am a Quantitative Researcher in Systematic Equities at [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/).

Prior to joining Citadel Securities, I obtained my Ph.D. in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in May 2023. My research interests include high dimensional statistics as well as differential privacy and deep learning. I am also interested in the intersection of AI and bioinformatics.

I obtained Bachelor of Art (B.A.) in Mathematics and Master of Mathematics (M.Math.) Degrees from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) before my PhD Journey.
